# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird game build in Pascal, as final project for my programming class in Highschool.

"FLAP.pas" is the main file of the project, it contains the code for the project.
  
  It is using some sort of Graphics modules available in Pascal at that time, 
which are used to implement Buttons and Mouse functionalities in the GUI.
